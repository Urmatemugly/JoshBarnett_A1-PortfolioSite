# READMe - Josh Barnett A1_Front End Developer
## Objective:
The first project  serves for a good opportunity to become familiar with HTML, CSS, git, command-line and markdown. 

## Intention:
Included in this repository is a wireframe.png file. This file will roughly show the desired design for my portfolio website. 

## Where I’m stuck:
- [x] placed all of the required HTML elements onto the page 
- [x] Included inline SVG (required logo) [with hover state colour change]
- [ ] margin-left/right:auto; does not seem centre all of the content on the page
- [ ] my logo & h1 elements are contained in the div-heading. At the smallest viewport the logo should displayed centred above h1 (flex:flex-wrap) 
- [ ] at medium viewport (tablet) - These elements should sit in a row, next to one another
- [ ] 2/4 required images are landscape profile and 2/4 are portrait - I’ll need to change out the landscape images for my desired design

### Project History:
I have experimented with _bootstrap_ previously for this project before learning how to properly utilise git. The repository for that project is stored on my local drive, without version control.
Since my design is relatively simple and I found some limitations in bootstrap (flex-box grid styles) I wanted to attempt this project using pure CSS.
